 	PTI further reported that the Supreme Court, however, agreed to examine the Constitutional validity of the Election Commission's notification for NOTA in elections. The court further said that the results for the upcoming polls will be declared as per schedule and sought the Election Commission's response on the plea filed by Gujarat Congress chief whip SM Parmar.

On Wednesday, the apex court had agreed to hear a plea moved by the Gujarat Congress challenging the decision to use NOTA option in the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls in the state.

A bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra had agreed to hear the plea after senior advocate Kapil Sibal mentioned the matter before it and sought urgent hearing. Sibal had told the apex court that there is no statutory provision with regard to NOTA in the Constitution.</p></div>
